		TODO LIST
		1.  forbid enemy spawning on the room where player spawned.
		2.  killing enemies, opening chests gives score.
		3.  death screen GUI.
		4.  main menu GUI.
		5.  chest spawning in rooms + locked chests in treasure rooms.
		6.  enemies drop items
		7.  stats-system (str, int, dex, HP) 
			   -> str: melee damage
			   -> int: magic damage
			   -> dex: ranged damage
			   -> HP: more health obviously.
		8.  simple "inventory/equipment"-system, where player can only wield one weapon and few pieces of equipment.
		9.  picking up items from the floor.
		10. golden key spawning/dropping randomly
		11. golden keys can open golden chests -> better loot/more points?
		12. create xml-parser for items
		13. create xml-file for items.
		14. health shrines -> 10% and 100% ones. Full health shrine located at lobby.
		15. simple storage system for items in lobby.
		16. diamond keys drop from bosses?? (diamond keys open up new dungeons or can be exchanged for goods in lobby)
		17. ---> bosses?
		18. session points do what exactly??? Think something cool.
		
		KNOWN BUGS:
		1. all tiles flash visible sometimes when attacking enemy
